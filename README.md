## Expected steps

You are suggested to implement layout according to design above and a single page application based on Vue and its modules. Application should be running on a root url (`/`). The sample data to use inside application **should be taken** here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allaud/bravado-quest/master/app/views/welcome/users.json.erb

Please note, the default app state contains all profile cards. When user starts typing, the results should be filtered in realtime, highlighting the matching string.

## The task highlights

* General SPA application performance, including searching, scrolling and highlighting speed.
* Quality of Vue single file components (SFC)
* HTML(JSX) and CSS quality
* JS code quality
* Search should be stateful (using browser url e.g. `/search/Boris`)
* Application should be published online for testing purposes
